## What is the IDT and how to locate it?
- The IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table) is an array with 256 8-byte entries with information to locate interrupt handlers. This array is indexed using interrupt or exception identifiers. The IDT can be located using the IDT register, a 48-bit register (i.e. 6 bytes) where the top 4 bytes contain the base of the IDT and the lower 2 bytes store the table limit. Each processor/core contain a different IDT and, therefore, the IDTR differs.
